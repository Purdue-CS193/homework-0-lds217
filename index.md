# Dat's First CS193 Homework
**Here is the list of some of my favorite things about CS193!**
- The instructor is super cool! He is still an undergrad, and he did a great job of teaching the lectures.
- No exam!!
- Terminal is just **"goat"**. I want to learn Terminal!
- We will learn latex!
- I am terrible at formatting, so it is great to know that we will learn code formatting and coding standards.
- Learn markdown because i'm bad at writing.
### That's it!
